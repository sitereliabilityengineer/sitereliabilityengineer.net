### WHO IS CRAZY MAN? SYSADMIN, MYTH, SRE OR A FLY?

Koldo is a site reliability engineer, sysadmin or whatever you want to call him&#8230;

He is working in IT for +15 years with some satisfied companies and customers on his back. He is always willing to help and to learn new technologies.

I really don&#8217;t like to speak about me in the third person, but it&#8217;s quite common!!! So I will stop now&#8230;

&nbsp;

I&#8217;m based in Madrid (Spain), but looking forward moving outside Spain.

&nbsp;

I love to work with other people, if they are kind with me, but I could also work, sometimes alone in the dark!

I started with a spectrum lot of years ago, but I also had some Sun Netra&#8217;s at home, and alpha workstation with Windows NT 64 and with Tru64 Unix, that almost caused me a separation. My wife is not very understanding, when she have&#8217;s a room with 5 or 6 computers and I don&#8217;t know why!!!!!!!!!

&nbsp;

What do I do in my spare time? I did lot of different sports, from yoga, to power lifting, bodybuilding, martial arts, running, etc&#8230; but I also love to go the cave, go to udemy, linuxacademy and start with new courses/training, etc&#8230;

&nbsp;

I have to say, that I love my profession, but I also like some party (not all the days ok?) going to the beach, strange films, music&#8230;

This is me, in one of my travels to Kalimantan (Indonesia). I&#8217;m the one on the right, if you have any doubt&#8230;.
