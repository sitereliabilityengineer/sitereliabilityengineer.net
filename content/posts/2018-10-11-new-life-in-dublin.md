I´m in Dublin living for 1 month !! Only in this year I´ve been living in 3 different countries (Spain, U.K, Ireland)

I´m very excited with this challenge, it´s something that everybody need to do 1 time in his life, but is also very stressful&#8230;.

I´m in a new role (SRE)

Hello Dublin!

This is a photo I shot few days ago&#8230;.
